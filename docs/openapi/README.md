# Viron OpenAPI Specification

This directory contains the **OpenAPI 3.0.3** specification for the Viron spatial simulation API.  
The specification defines endpoints, request/response formats, and DTO schemas for all core domain objects.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Files

- **viron-api.json** â€“ The complete OpenAPI definition for the Viron API, covering:
  - **Environments** â€“ Create, read, update, and delete environments.
  - **Grids** â€“ Retrieve grids and their relationships to environments and entities.
  - **Locations** â€“ Manage locations, including entity placement and removal.
  - **Entities** â€“ Access and manage entities in the simulation.
  - **Debug Utilities** â€“ Endpoints for generating sample data and test scenarios.

---

## ðŸ§© Structure

The API is organized around **domain-specific controllers**:

- **EnvironmentController** â€“ Handles environment-level operations.
- **GridController** â€“ Handles grid-related retrieval and relationships.
- **LocationController** â€“ Manages spatial locations and entity placement.
- **DebugController** â€“ Provides testing and demonstration endpoints.

Each path in the spec reflects a **clear mapping to a domain object**, ensuring maintainability and discoverability.

## ðŸ—‚ DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)

The specification uses DTOs for all request and response bodies.  
This ensures:
- **Consistency** in API contracts.
- **Clarity** for consumers of the API.
- **Separation** of internal models from public API.

Key DTOs include:
- `EnvironmentDTO`
- `CreateEnvironmentRequest`
- `UpdateEnvironmentNameRequest`
- `GridDTO`
- `LocationDTO`
- `EntityDTO`

## ðŸš€ Usage

1. **View the spec**
   - Use any OpenAPI-compatible viewer such as [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/) or [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/).

2. **Test the API**
   - Start the Viron application locally.
   - Use the endpoints defined in `viron-api.json` to interact with the service.

3. **Generate clients or servers**
   - Use OpenAPI code generation tools (e.g., `openapi-generator-cli`) to scaffold API clients or server stubs.
