# Viron

Viron is a **2D spatial simulation management service** that provides APIs for creating and managing **environments**, **grids**, **locations**, and **entities**.  
It serves as a reusable backend component for simulation-based games, AI experiments, and virtual world applications.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

Viron abstracts away low-level spatial data management so client applications can focus on simulation logic, rendering, and game mechanics.

Core responsibilities:
- Managing hierarchical spatial structures (environments â†’ grids â†’ locations).
- Tracking entity placement and movement.
- Providing clean, testable REST APIs.
- Offering debug tools for rapid development and testing.

## ðŸ“¦ Features (MVP Scope)

The MVP implements the endpoints defined in `openapi/viron-api.json` and documented in `docs/MVP.md`.

**Environment Management**
- Create, retrieve, update, and delete environments.
- Query environments by ID, name, or contained entity.

**Grid Management**
- Retrieve grids by ID or environment.
- Find the grid containing a specific entity.

**Location Management**
- Retrieve locations by ID, grid, or environment.
- Manage entity placement in locations.

**Entity Management**
- Create, retrieve, and delete entities.

**Debug Utilities**
- Generate sample environments, grids, locations, and entities.
- Quickly create a world and place an entity for testing.
